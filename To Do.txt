Playtest:
4.5 Colin:
1. I’m a little confused by the system. Are certain enemies harder to defeat than others?
2. How do you get past the upgrade selection? It seems to be stuck there so I can’t get to day 2.
3. Is there a penalty system for using too many of your characters?
3. I think it would be nice to have an intro screen that explains the game more, like with some of your previous games.
