Playtest:
4.4 Colin:
- I’m a little confused by the system. Are certain enemies harder to defeat than others?
- How do you get past the upgrade selection? It seems to be stuck there so I can’t get to day 2.
- Is there a penalty system for using too many of your characters?
- I think it would be nice to have an intro screen that explains the game more, like with some of your previous games.
4.5 Colin:
- Super helpful! So I found a bug. On level 3 I kept on dying and upgrading my spirits.
    Because of that I had a bunch of really strong spirits that blew through the enemies without me needing
    to use many of them.  However, The screen didn't recognize that I had beat all the enemies so it kept in lvl 3.
    Even after I pressed all of the spirit cards, it stuck in lvl 3.
- I would also say that maybe instead of having an instruction pop up every time something new happens,
    have a one or 2 page instruction that people can click through that tells them everything they need to
    know to get started (Like exp. is pretty standard so it might not need an explanation, but spirits and
    enemies characteristics may be helpful). That way the flow of  gameplay isn't  interrupted with instructional
    stops and starts.
4.6 Rony:
- I did feel stress and i love the design
- I wasn't sure exactly how to strategies
- I think i started strategising when i got the faster minions
4.6 Emre:
- Stone was fasted than the bushes (bug)
- I thought I could just press the defenses as they come and win until Day 4, it got much harder by then
- Then I had to wait a little, spawn the slow ones first and then the faster ones so that by the time they encountered
    the winter spirits there were multiple of them in the same spot
- One thing is that there is no indication of how you are doing as you are playing - like how many more winter spirits
    are coming or how many defenses you have remaining
4.9 Xuesong:
- It gave great aesthetic pleasure
